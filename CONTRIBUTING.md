# Contributing guidelines

Thanks for coming onboard to contribute to this project. 

All features should not be commited directly to the ``main`` or ``dev`` branches, unless you have a very specific reason to do so (eg. CI/CD testing). Otherwise, checkout a new branch and open a PR.

Please follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) when making commits to the ``main``/``dev`` branches, and it is highly recommended to do the same on all other branches.

Before merging a PR, please check that CI/CD tests pass and that you have tested your own changes.
